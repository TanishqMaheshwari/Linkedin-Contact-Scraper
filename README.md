# Linkedin-Contact-Scraper
Built by Front Row Ventures' Business Development Team in order to more efficiently source contacts. Utilizes BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web scraping.

## Getting Started
Within `parameters_real.py`:
- adjust the `search_query` parameter to include the search results that you would like to see 
- add your login credentials to the `linkedin_username` and `linkedin_password` parameters. 

Note: in `controller_script.py` you should set the seed to a different value everytime, this randomizes the time between clicks by the computer to mimic the actions of a human. Unauthorized webscraping on Linkedin is prohibited, so use this program at your own discretion.
